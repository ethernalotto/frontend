# A Lottery Is Born

Hello, world!

Today we are proud to present **EthernaLotto**: a global, decentralized, autonomous, and provably
fair lottery based on Ethereum[^1].

Have any numbers stuck with you, lately? Maybe you dreamed them? A fortune teller told you?

[Go ahead and play them](/)! **We draw 6 numbers on Saturday evening every week** and award rich
prizes to all tickets matching 2 or more numbers!

Good luck,

Jim on behalf of the EthernaLotto Team

[^1]: If you are new to [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) we recommend installing
[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) to get started. See ["How to Play"](/howtoplay) for details.
